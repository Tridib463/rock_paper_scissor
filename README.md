This is a simple Rock Paper Scissor game. This is one of my first projects.
I have made this with HTML , CSS and JAVASCIPT.
All the codes are available in my Repo.
I have also hosted this project on GitHub and you can access that by clicking on the link - https://tridib463.github.io/rock_paper_scissor/
